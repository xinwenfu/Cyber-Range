# Cyber-Range

UMass Lowell has a virtual Cyber Range, called Cyber Range for brevity. We offer remote access to virtual machines (VMs) hosted over Cyber Range, which is behind a firewall. To access the VMs, a person has to acquire an OpenVPN profile and use OpenVPN to connect to our OpenVPN server. Once connected to the OpenVPN server, a person may access the VMs in a few ways: (i) web access; (ii) Mcirsoft Remote Desktop; (iii) SSH (e.g. Putty) if a SSH server runs on the particular VM.
